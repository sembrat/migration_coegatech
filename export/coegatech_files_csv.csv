"7294","669","What's the difference between a master of science vs. a professional mater's degree? A master of science (MS) is a degree that emphasizes research and the in-depth study of the theory, history and methodologies of an academic field. MS students wish to contribute new knowledge or research to their field while strengthening their research and critical thinking skills. If you want to conduct research and become a producer of knowledge, gain in-depth expertise for solving new and complex problems, or you want to pursue a Ph.D. or career in academia, then this degree is right for you. For admission, you are required to take the GRE or GMAT, have a bachelor's degree, letters of reference, an essay and resume. A professional master's (PM) is a degree that emphasizes knowledge and hands-on experience that can be used immediately in non-academic professions and careers. It's best for learners who are established in their profession and wish to strengthen their leadership and technical skills to advance their career. If you prefer an emphasis on experience over research, you want practical skills and knowledge that can be used immediately in your profession, and you wish to increase your marketability in your field, then this degree is right for you. You will need a bachelor's degree and at least five years work experience, letters of reference (including an employer), an essay and resume. GRE/GMAT is not required. ","image/png","lr-pmaster_vs_m_science.png","public://uploads/2018/10/lr-pmaster_vs_m_science.png","Permanent","1538675481","2018","10"
